Thank you for your interest in the Engineering Manager role on Google Search.

Our hiring committee reviewed your application through our rigorous consensus-based process (5 interviewers must unanimously agree, which statistically ensures we reject everyone). We've decided not to proceed.

Feedback from your packet:
- You described your management style as "servant leadership." At Google, we practice "committee leadership," where every decision requires 4 approvals and a design doc.
- Your team retention rate was 92%. Impressive, but our hiring committee wondered if your team just couldn't find better jobs. (We're kidding. Mostly.)
- You mentioned "protecting the team from distractions." At Google, the distractions ARE the strategy. We can't have a manager who filters them out.

Best,

Thank you for your interest in the Senior Manager role at Amazon Retail.

After a review process that embodied Insist on the Highest Standards, we have decided not to move forward.

Our Bar Raiser assessment:
- You demonstrated 12 of 16 Leadership Principles. While this exceeds most companies' entire value systems, at Amazon it represents a 25% deficiency.
- Your operational narrative was only 4 pages. A 6-pager is not a suggestion. It's not a guideline. It's not a "rough target." It is six pages.
- When asked about your biggest failure, you described a project that was 2 weeks late. At Amazon, a real failure involves an entire service going down on Prime Day. Your failures aren't ambitious enough.

Remember: it's Day 1. Unless you're applying here. Then it's over.

Thank you for applying to the Director of Engineering role at Meta.

After our leadership team reviewed your candidacy, we've decided not to proceed. In the spirit of Meta's culture of openness (which exists between reorgs), here's our feedback:

- Your org design proposal assumed stable team structures. At Meta, we reorganize quarterly to keep everyone adaptive. Or confused. Both, really.
- You expressed interest in "long-term platform investment." Our planning horizon is currently set to "whatever AI trend emerged this week."
- You asked about reporting structure. It will change before your start date, during your onboarding, and at least twice before your first performance review. If this concerns you, this is not the right fit.

We wish you stability in your next role. We certainly can't offer it here.

After careful review through our growth mindset lens, we've decided not to proceed. Here's our feedback:

- Your product strategy proposal was submitted as a Google Doc. We understand it may have been a test of our commitment to interoperability. We failed the test, and so did you.
- You suggested simplifying the Microsoft 365 pricing tiers. We currently have 14 SKUs, each with different feature sets, and this is by design. Simplicity is for consumer products. We sell complexity to enterprises, and they love it.
- Your AI product vision didn't mention Copilot once. Everything at Microsoft is Copilot now. The word "Copilot" should appear in every sentence, every slide, and ideally every dream.

Thank you for your interest in the VP of Engineering role at Netflix.

Our leadership team applied the keeper test to your candidacy. The question we ask: "Would we fight to keep this candidate if they tried to leave for another company?" The answer: "We would write them a strong LinkedIn recommendation."

In the spirit of radical candor:
- Your leadership experience is extensive. However, you led teams that used "sprints" and "story points." At Netflix, we don't have sprints. We have "continuous delivery of value by stunning colleagues who don't need a framework to tell them when to ship."
- You proposed a team growth plan. At Netflix, we believe in "highly aligned, loosely coupled" teams. Your plan was too tightly coupled to the concept of hiring more people. Sometimes the answer is fewer, better people.
- You mentioned "retaining talent." At Netflix, we don't retain talent. We attract stunning colleagues, and if they stop being stunning, we generously help them find their next opportunity.

Thank you for your interest in the Engineering Director role for Siri & AI Experiences at Apple.

We've reviewed your candidacy and decided not to proceed. We asked Siri for a summary of the decision:

"I found some results on the web for 'why this candidate wasn't hired.'"

(We're still working on Siri. Obviously.)

What we can share:
- Your interview mentioned "cloud-based AI" 14 times. At Apple, AI runs on-device. The cloud is where other companies put your data. We don't do that.
- You proposed moving faster by reducing privacy constraints. At Apple, privacy is not a constraint. It is the feature. You would not suggest removing the screen from an iPhone.
- Your leadership style emphasized "moving fast and breaking things." At Apple, we move deliberately and break nothing. Except occasionally Siri.
