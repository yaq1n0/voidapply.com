Thank you for applying to the Product Manager, Cloud AI position at Google.

After reviewing your application with our state-of-the-art candidate evaluation model (which, ironically, is one of the Cloud AI products you'd be managing), we've decided to pursue other candidates at this time.

Specifically, our evaluation highlighted that you did not include a single strategy framework reference in your resume. No RICE scoring, no weighted impact matrices, no 2x2 prioritization grids. We're not sure you even know what a PRD is.

We're also concerned that you listed "launched products still alive after 3 years" as an achievement. At Google, we view product shutdown as a feature, not a bug.

We wish you the best,

Thank you for applying to the Product Manager role on Instagram Growth at Meta.

We've decided not to move forward with your application. Here's some candid feedback:

Your product sense assessment proposed a feature that prioritized user well-being over engagement metrics. While admirable, this approach is fundamentally incompatible with our growth model. We need PMs who can increase daily active usage by 15% while maintaining plausible deniability about addiction mechanics.

Additionally, during the hypothetical crisis scenario, you suggested "being transparent with users." We appreciate creative thinking, but let's be realistic.
