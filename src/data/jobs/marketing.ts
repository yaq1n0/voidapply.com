Thanks for applying to the Growth Marketing Manager role at Meta.

We ran your application through our ad targeting system to find the ideal candidate, and unfortunately, your profile was not served an interview.

Your relevance score was too low. Specifically:
- Your application had a 2.3% click-through rate with our hiring panel (industry average for rejection emails: 2.4%)
- Your "conversion" from resume to phone screen was below our ROAS threshold
- You were outbid by 47 other candidates in the attention auction

We recommend optimizing your resume creative, testing new headlines, and retargeting us in Q3.

Best,
Meta Marketing Recruiting

Thank you for your interest in the Brand Marketing Lead position for Google Pixel.

After reviewing your application, we've decided to move forward with other candidates. Our hiring committee provided the following feedback:

Your marketing portfolio was submitted from an iPhone. We ran the EXIF data. We know.

Additionally, your campaign proposals focused on "competing with Apple." At Google Pixel, we don't compete with Apple. We are on our own journey. A different journey. A journey where market share is just a number and brand love is what really matters. (Please don't ask about the market share numbers.)

Thanks for your interest in the Content Marketing Manager role at Tesla.

After reviewing your application through first principles thinking, we've decided not to proceed.

Our concerns:
1. Your resume mentions a "marketing budget." At Tesla, we've eliminated the concept of marketing budgets. It's an outdated paradigm. Real marketing is when the CEO tweets and the stock moves 15%.
2. You proposed a content strategy that includes "planned campaigns." At Tesla, content is created reactively, usually in response to a 1 AM tweet that we need to contextualize by market open.
3. Your portfolio includes paid advertising work. We don't do paid advertising. We do "earned media through controversy."

Also, you arrived at the interview in a non-Tesla vehicle. HR has been notified.

Thank you for applying to the Senior Performance Marketing Manager role at Netflix.

In the spirit of radical candor: no.

Our team evaluated your application and determined you are not a stunning colleague fit for this role. Specifically:

- Your case study showed a 4.2x ROAS. At Netflix, we expect at least 6x. We are top of market in expectations as well as compensation.
- You proposed a "brand awareness" campaign. At Netflix, we believe in performance or nothing. Brand is what happens when performance marketing is really good.
- Your Netflix account is on the ad-supported tier. We appreciate the honesty of including your subscriber ID, but this raised concerns about your commitment to premium experiences.

We operate like a pro sports team. Today, you've been cut.

Mahalo for your interest in the Director of Product Marketing role for Salesforce AI.

After reviewing your application with our Ohana hiring values, we've decided not to move forward. Our Einstein AI candidate assessment tool flagged the following:

- Your marketing portfolio did not include the word "trust" enough times. At Salesforce, "trust" is our #1 value, and we expected to see it at least 14 times in your cover letter (you had 3).
- Your product launch case study did not reference Dreamforce. All product launches happen at Dreamforce. Even the ones in March.
- You proposed marketing AI features based on what they actually do. At Salesforce, we market AI features based on what they could theoretically do in an ideal demo environment.

We hope to see you at Dreamforce as an attendee, even if not as an employee!

Ohana always,

We've decided not to deliver on your application at this time. Estimated delivery of an interview: never. (Note: this timeline may change due to high demand in your area.)

Our feedback:
- Your brand strategy proposed "transparent pricing." While we appreciate the creativity, this conflicts with our current business model of distributing the total cost across enough line items that no one realizes they're paying $30 for a sandwich.
- You suggested partnering with restaurants that make their own delivery apps. That's like suggesting Uber partner with public transit. (Actually, we did that. Forget this point.)
