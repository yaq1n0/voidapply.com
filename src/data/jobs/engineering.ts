Thank you for your interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer position at Google. After careful consideration by our AI-powered screening system (which spent approximately 0.003 seconds reviewing your application), we have decided to move forward with other candidates.

We encourage you to apply again in 6 months, when we'll post the same role with even more unrealistic requirements.

We'll keep your resume on file.*

Specifically, we practiced radical candor with your resume and determined the following:
- Your GitHub contribution graph had several gray squares. At Netflix, we expect a continuous shade of green. Rest days are for adequate performers.
- You described yourself as a "team player." At Netflix, we're a team of individual superstars. Think less "soccer" and more "professional wrestling."

After reviewing your application using first principles thinking, we've decided not to move forward. Here's our reasoning:

First principle: The best engineers are those who are willing to sleep at the factory. Your resume mentions "hobbies" and "work-life balance," which suggests you occasionally leave buildings. This is incompatible with our culture.

Additionally, you listed 8 hours of sleep as a daily activity. Our CEO has publicly stated that 6 hours is the maximum for productive humans. You are 33% over budget on sleep.
