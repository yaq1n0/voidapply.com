Thank you for applying to the Senior UX Designer position at Apple.

After a meticulous review (we spent 3 hours on your portfolio, which is how long we spend on a single icon), we've decided not to move forward.

Our design review panel noted the following concerns:
- Your portfolio uses the font Roboto. We cannot overstate how disqualifying this is.
- One of your mockups featured a hamburger menu. At Apple, we do not acknowledge the existence of hamburger menus.
- Your case study included the phrase "good enough." There is no "good enough" at Apple. There is only "magical" and "unacceptable."

We encourage you to reapply once your design sensibility has been sufficiently refined. We recommend staring at an iPhone home screen for 6 months as preparation.

Regards,

Thank you for applying to the UX Researcher role at Google.

We conducted a brief usability study on your application (n=1, our recruiter) and found the following:

Task completion rate: 0%. The recruiter was unable to identify a clear research methodology in your cover letter. They abandoned the task after 30 seconds (which, to be fair, is longer than most people spend on applications here).

Net Promoter Score for your resume: -47. Our recruiter would "definitely not recommend" your application to the hiring manager.

We encourage you to iterate on your application based on this feedback. Consider conducting user research on what hiring managers actually want to read.

Thanks for your interest in the Product Designer role for Facebook Marketplace at Meta.

After reviewing your portfolio, our design team has decided to pass. Here's why:

Your case study showed a clean, organized marketplace design. This tells us you've never actually used Facebook Marketplace. Our users list items with 0 photos, descriptions like "u know what it is," and prices that are either $1 or $9,999 with "price is negotiable" in the comments.

We need a designer who understands this chaos, not one who tries to impose order on it.

Also, your portfolio was submitted as a Figma link. Unfortunately, one of our design directors clicked it and it crashed their browser, which reminds them of an internal tool incident they'd rather forget.

- Use of green (#1DB954): 0 times. Concerning brand alignment.
- Mobile-first designs: technically yes, but they looked like desktop designs squeezed into a phone

Our squad voted 3-2 against, which in our consensus-driven culture means we'll revisit this in 6 months when the squad has been reorganized into a different tribe.

After our team reviewed your portfolio with radical candor, we've decided not to move forward. In the spirit of our culture, here's our unfiltered feedback:

Your portfolio is a solid 7/10. At Netflix, we only hire 10s. We're a dream team, not a development league.

Specific notes:
- Your typography choices were safe. We want dangerous typography.
- One of your case studies used a stock photo. We could tell. We always can.
- Your color palette was described as "pleasant." At Netflix, we aim for "emotionally devastating."

This is not a reflection of your worth as a designer. It is, however, a reflection of our impossibly high standards.

We've decided not to move forward with your application. Your estimated interview time was 2 weeks away, but due to high demand, that timeline has surged to never.

Our review panel noted the following:
- Your portfolio case study proposed reducing surge pricing visibility. This is in direct conflict with our revenue model.
- Your "ideal ride experience" mockup included an accurate ETA. We appreciate the optimism, but it's not realistic.
- You designed a complaint flow that actually resolves issues. Our support team found this destabilizing.
