Thank you for your interest in the Investment Banking Analyst position at Goldman Sachs.

After a rigorous evaluation process that mirrors the intensity of the role itself, we have decided not to extend an offer at this time.

Our screening committee noted the following:
- Your university is not on our target school list. We checked twice. Once at 2 AM, which is when we make most decisions.
- Your financial modeling test contained a circular reference. In banking, circular references belong in deal structures, not spreadsheets.
- You listed "work-life balance" as a career priority. We had to Google this term. We are still unclear on what it means.

We encourage you to gain 2-3 years of experience at a lesser bank and reapply.

Regards,
Goldman Sachs Campus Recruiting

Thanks for applying to the Senior Financial Analyst role at Stripe.

We've reviewed your application and, after running the numbers (which is sort of our whole thing), decided not to proceed.

Our analysis:
- NPV of hiring you: negative (using a 12% discount rate, which is generous)
- Your financial model had a hardcoded assumption on row 47. At Stripe, all assumptions must be dynamic, documented, and defensible in a 30-minute review.
- You used VLOOKUP instead of INDEX-MATCH. This is 2024. We have standards.

We recommend optimizing your resume's unit economics before reapplying.

After a thorough review aligned with our Leadership Principles, we have decided not to move forward.

Our Bar Raiser provided the following feedback:
- Your financial model was built in Excel. At Amazon, we use internal tools that are worse but proprietary.
- You projected 15% YoY growth for AWS. Our actual growth rate is classified, but we can confirm your number was wrong.
- When asked about Frugality, you mentioned "cost optimization." The correct answer was "door-desks." It's always door-desks.

Thank you for applying to the Corporate Finance Lead position at Alphabet.

After reviewing your application with the same rigor we apply to our moonshot investments (which is to say, with optimism and limited financial justification), we've decided not to proceed.

Our concerns:
- Your DCF model used a 10-year projection. Our Other Bets division requires 30-year projections minimum. If your model doesn't extend to 2054, it's not ambitious enough.
- You valued Waymo using traditional automotive industry comparables. We prefer to be valued as "priceless" or "the future."
- You asked about profitability timelines. At Other Bets, we consider profitability a horizon event — always approaching, never arriving.

Thanks for applying to the Senior Manager, FP&A role at Uber.

Your application has been reviewed, and we've decided not to move forward. Here's a breakdown of the fees — sorry, the feedback:

- Your financial model assumed linear growth. At Uber, growth is nonlinear, unpredictable, and heavily weather-dependent.
- You valued our food delivery business using restaurant industry multiples. We prefer "tech company multiples," which are higher for reasons no one can fully explain.
- During the case study, you asked "what's the path to profitability?" We've been asking that for 14 years. Welcome to the club, but from the outside.

Convenience fee: $2.99
Review surcharge: $1.49

Thanks for applying to the Financial Controller role at Tesla Gigafactory.

Using first principles analysis, we've broken down your candidacy into fundamental components:

1. Accounting knowledge: adequate
2. Manufacturing experience: present
3. Ability to survive in a Tesla work environment: unproven

Our assessment team was particularly concerned that your resume mentions "standard working hours." At the Gigafactory, the factory runs 24/7, and so does finance. We close the books when the books are done, not when the clock says 5 PM.

Additionally, you listed "risk-averse" as a professional trait. At Tesla, we view risk as a feature, not a bug. Our entire financial strategy is built on first principles, not precedent. If you need precedent to feel comfortable, this is not the role.
