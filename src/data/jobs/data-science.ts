Thank you for applying to the Senior Data Scientist role at Netflix.

We ran your application through our proprietary candidate evaluation model, and the results were not promising:

- P(interview | your resume) = 0.003
- P(offer | interview) = 0.12
- P(surviving the keeper test for 2 years | offer) = 0.47
- Expected value of hiring you: below threshold

Our model also flagged that you listed "basic Excel" as a skill. At Netflix, mentioning Excel in a data science application is like mentioning a tricycle in a Formula 1 interview.

We applied a generous Bayesian prior in your favor and still arrived at a rejection.

Thank you for your interest in the Research Scientist position at Google DeepMind.

Key findings:
- Your h-index is 23. The median h-index of our recent hires is 47. We appreciate quality over quantity, but we also appreciate quantity.
- Your most-cited paper has 312 citations. Our minimum threshold is "enough citations that Wikipedia references it."
- You listed PyTorch as your primary framework. We invented JAX. This is not explicitly disqualifying, but it was noted. Twice.

We encourage you to continue publishing and reapply when your research has been featured in at least one existential AI risk op-ed.

After consulting with our human hiring committee (who, unlike Alexa, can process nuanced requests), we've decided not to move forward. Our assessment:

- Your NLU experience is strong, but you failed to reference Customer Obsession in your research statement. At Amazon, even gradient descent should be customer-obsessed.
