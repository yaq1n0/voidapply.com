Mahalo for your interest in the Enterprise Account Executive role at Salesforce.

After evaluating your application through our CRM (naturally), we've decided not to move forward. Your lead score was below our threshold:

- Pipeline generation potential: 62/100 (we need 85+)
- Ohana alignment: 34/100 (you didn't mention Ohana once. ONCE.)
- Dreamforce readiness: 12/100 (your LinkedIn profile photo does not include a Hawaiian shirt)

Your application has been moved to "Closed — Lost" in our ATS (which runs on Salesforce, obviously).

We recommend building a stronger personal brand, growing your LinkedIn following to at least 10,000 connections, and posting more inspirational sales quotes.

Ohana means family. But not your family. Our family. And you're not in it. Yet.

Aloha,

Thank you for applying to the Azure Cloud Solutions Architect role at Microsoft.

After reviewing your application with a growth mindset, we've determined that your growth needs more time to grow.

Specific feedback:
- Your cloud experience is primarily AWS. While we appreciate cross-platform knowledge, you listed "aws" in your skills section 11 times and "Azure" 0 times. Even saying "the other cloud" would have been preferable.
- Your demo reel included a slide that said "all clouds are basically the same." This may be technically defensible but is culturally disqualifying at Microsoft.
- You proposed a customer migration strategy that was "cloud-agnostic." At Microsoft, the only cloud is Azure. The concept of "agnosticism" does not apply.

We recommend spending 6 months earning Azure certifications and then reapplying. We have 47 certifications available, and yes, you should get all of them.

Empowering every candidate to achieve more (elsewhere),

Thank you for applying to the Google Cloud Sales Representative role.

Our AI-powered candidate evaluation system (running on Google Cloud, naturally — we practice what we sell) has determined that you are not a fit at this time.

Analysis:
- Your sales experience is impressive, but 80% of your closed deals were with AWS. We appreciate the domain expertise, but this is like hiring a Coca-Cola salesperson and asking them to sell Pepsi. Actually, it's more like asking them to sell RC Cola. We're being honest with ourselves.
- Your compensation expectations exceed our budget. At Google Cloud, we invest heavily in the product and moderately in the sales team. It's a different philosophy.
- You asked about our market share strategy. We prefer to focus on "growth rate" rather than "share." It's a framing thing.

Thanks for applying to the Solutions Architect role at Stripe.

We evaluated your application and unfortunately need to return a 402 — Payment Required. Just kidding. It's a 404 — Offer Not Found.

Our assessment:
- Your technical demo during the interview worked on the first try. While normally positive, this made our panel suspicious. Our own demos fail 30% of the time. Perfection is uncanny.
- You described webhook retries as "annoying." At Stripe, webhook retries are a feature of our reliability architecture. Respecting the retry is essential to the culture.
- Your code sample used var instead of const. This is 2026. We have immutability standards.

We recommend contributing to our open-source projects and reapplying once you've achieved the correct emotional attachment to HTTP status codes.

Thank you for your interest in the AWS Enterprise Account Manager role.

After a thorough review aligned with our Leadership Principles, we have decided not to proceed.

"Alexa, why was this candidate rejected?"
"According to the Bar Raiser, the candidate demonstrated insufficient Customer Obsession. They referred to customers as 'accounts.' At Amazon, they are customers. Always."

Additional feedback:
- Your sales methodology is "consultative selling." At Amazon, we prefer "Leadership Principle-based selling." Every discovery question should map to a specific LP.
- You quoted your OTE expectations. At Amazon, we discuss total comp as base + RSUs + sign-on bonus, divided by a complex vesting formula that ensures maximum retention anxiety.
- You mentioned "work-life balance" when asked about availability. Our enterprise customers are global. The sun never sets on AWS, and neither should you.

Thanks for applying to the Head of Business Development role for Uber for Business.

We've decided not to move forward with your candidacy. Your application was in transit but never arrived. (We know the feeling.)

Feedback:
- Your sales plan estimated a 6-month ramp period. At Uber, we expect revenue from day one. We move fast, and so should our sales team's quota attainment.
- You proposed enterprise pricing that was transparent and easy to understand. Our corporate pricing involves dynamic rates, booking fees, platform fees, and a tier structure that requires a spreadsheet to navigate. Simplicity is the enemy of revenue optimization.
- You asked about the company car policy. At Uber, we don't have company cars. We have company rides. Using a competitor's app for personal travel is grounds for a stern Slack message.

Your application status: cancelled (no fee, this time).
