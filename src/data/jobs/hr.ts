Thank you for applying to the People Partner role at Google.

After a thorough review by our People Operations team (yes, we review our own applications — it's exactly as recursive as it sounds), we've decided not to move forward.

Our feedback:
- During the case study, you referred to employees as "resources." At Google, we call them "Googlers." Referring to humans as resources is something we save for our cloud computing division.
- You proposed a performance review cycle of once per year. At Google, performance reviews happen every 6 months, take 3 months to complete, and the results are available 2 months later. By the time you get feedback, it's already time for the next review.
- You mentioned "HR." We don't have HR. We have People Operations. This distinction has no practical impact, but it is culturally essential.

Best,
Google People Operations Recruiting

Thanks for applying to the Head of Recruiting role at Meta.

In a twist of poetic irony, we are rejecting the person who applied to lead our rejection efforts.

Our feedback:
- Your recruiting strategy proposed "employer brand improvement." At Meta, our employer brand is... what it is. We prefer to focus on total compensation, which can make candidates forget about any brand concerns. Money is a very effective brand strategy.
- You suggested reducing time-to-hire to 30 days. Our current process involves 6 interviews, a hiring committee review, and a compensation calibration that requires its own hiring committee. 30 days is ambitious. 90 days is realistic. 120 days is common.
- You asked about headcount stability. We appreciate the humor.

Thank you for applying to the Talent Partner role at Netflix.

In the spirit of radical candor, here is our unfiltered assessment:

You are an adequate HR professional. At Netflix, adequate gets a generous severance. Since you don't work here yet, you just get this email.

Specific feedback:
- Your approach to performance management included phrases like "growth opportunity" and "development plan." At Netflix, we don't have development plans. We have the keeper test. You either are a keeper or you're freed up to be a stunning colleague somewhere else.
- You proposed an employee engagement survey. At Netflix, we don't survey engagement. We assume all stunning colleagues are engaged. If they're not, we help them find a company where they will be.
- Your salary expectations were at market rate. At Netflix, we pay top of market. But your performance expectations were also at market rate, which creates a compensation/performance mismatch.

With radical candor,

Thank you for your interest in the HR Business Partner role at AWS.

After reviewing your application against our Leadership Principles (all 16 of them), we have decided not to move forward.

Key feedback:
- Your approach to employee relations emphasized "empathy" and "psychological safety." While these concepts exist at Amazon, they are filtered through our Leadership Principles. For example, empathy at Amazon is called "Earn Trust." Psychological safety is called "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit."
- You mentioned reducing attrition as a key goal. At Amazon, we track URA — Unregretted Attrition — which means some attrition is not only expected but desired. Your proposal to retain everyone suggests a misalignment with our philosophy.
- Your performance management philosophy was "grow and develop." At Amazon, we prefer "raise the bar," which is subtly but meaningfully different.

This decision was made using our standard 6-page narrative review process. The document was 6 pages. Your application was 2. The math didn't work.

Thank you for your interest in the Inclusion & Diversity Program Manager role at Apple.

After a thoughtful review, we've decided not to proceed with your application at this time. While we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce, we are also committed to finding the exact right candidate for this specific role, and your profile didn't match our current requirements.

We recognize the irony of sending a form rejection letter for an inclusion role. We are working on that.

Our feedback:
- Your proposed DEI metrics framework focused on representation data. At Apple, we believe inclusion is felt, not just measured. Unfortunately, we also need to measure it for the annual report.
- You suggested transparent pay equity reporting. We appreciate the ambition, but at Apple, information is shared on a need-to-know basis. Even inclusion data.
- Your interview presentation used Android screenshots as examples of inclusive design. We... have no notes beyond the obvious.
